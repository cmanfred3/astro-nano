I worked as Food Service Director for Aramark for seven years across 3 different states. I gained skills in food service operations, financial planning & analysis, and building customer relationships, student and administrator alike. I learned how our country's food system worked, and more importantly how it didn't work, in feeding kids across America. I brought experimental programs to school districts, including a school district food truck, breakfast before the bell programs, and hydroponic gardens.
