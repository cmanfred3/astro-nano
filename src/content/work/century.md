Currently the Controller for Century Pharmaceuticals. I lead the annual budgeting, monthly reporting, and long-term financial planning processes. I provide insights into revenue growth, expense management, and profitability to the COO on a weekly basis and to ownership on a monthly basis. I started in an analyst role and was promoted to Controller in 2025. My time at Century has taught me how to transform a mom and pop operation into a 21st Century professional business.
